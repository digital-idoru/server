Server/Client Project for CSI416

A simple Server and Client applications for a Computer Networking class I'm currently taking. 
The Server will accept connections from the client and then will be able to execute some simple directory commands. 

1) Currently, the server can only handle one client at a time. There will eventually be multithreading to handle multiple clients, but for now the purposes of this current assignment it's only going to handle one at a time. 

2) The client hasn't been written yet. I've been debugging the server portion before I even start on the client. I test everything with telnet... 

3) GET and PUT commands aren't implemented yet. The professor hasn't made it clear what he wants for these commands yet, so I'm waiting on them. Right now, everything else seems pretty stable.
